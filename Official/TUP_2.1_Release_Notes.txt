This is an "emergency" release to support Pale Moon 28.

Known Issues:
* The Tab Groups' tab twisty icon does not show up, I have been unable to determine why.

Workarounds:
* The keystroke [Ctrl][Alt]-[+] will expand the current selected tab group 
** (or all tab groups if none are selected or the current tab group is already expanded)
* The keystroke [Ctrl][Alt]-[-] will collapse the current selected tab group 
** (or all tab groups if none are selected or the current tab group is already collapsed)
* Right click on a tab group tab, under the "Tab Stack" submenu select "Expand Stack" or "Collapse" stack as needed.
